some problems i faced:

the mixed fruit dataset in it barely had 25 images which skewed the accuracy of the models so remove that class for best accuracy.
add data augmentation in the CNN model which will give you 95% accuracy and a higher f1 score
make sure to ignore the xml files since the model wasnt able to accept it as a valid file type
do not run the epoch cell too many times cause it could decrease the accuracy sometimes, or at least thats what happened for me
